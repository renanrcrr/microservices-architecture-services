# Microservices architecture with 5 different services

This implementation shoes a Java code snippet illustrating a microservices architecture with 5 different services. 

Each service was a simple "Hello World" service, just to demonstrate the structure of microservices. 

I just simplified this demonstration and did not include error handling, proper configuration management, security considerations, and other essential aspects of a production-ready microservices implementation. 

Remember, make sure to have the necessary Spring Boot and Spring Cloud dependencies in the project for this code to work properly.
